          # How Istio Helps
          Istio helps implement access enforcement in two ways: limiting service-to-service access (see AC-4 below),
          and acting as an enforcement point for end user authentication and authorization (AC-3, this section).
          - Service to Service Access: Istio provides authenticatable runtime identities for all applications in the mesh in the form of X.509 certificates.
            Those certificates are used for encryption in transit as well as authentication of the service's identity.
            This authenticated principal can be used for access control of service to service communication via Istio's AuthorizationPolicy.
            We cover this in detail in AC-4, Information Flow Enforcement, below.
          - End User Authentication and Authorization: Istio facilitates end user authentication and authorization in two ways:
            1. Istio has native support for JWT authentication and authorization based on JWT claims.
               It can be configured to extract a JWT from each request's headers, validate them against issuers and with specific keys, and limit access based on any of the JWT's fields.
            2. Istio supports extracting metadata from each request and forwarding it to an external authentication and authorization server.
               Istio will enforce the verdict returned by this server, and can attach additional metadata returned by the server (e.g., an internal JWT in place of an external API key).

          # How does Istio help?
          Istio encrypts all in-mesh communication at runtime using the service's identity. 
          This provides TLS for all applications in the mesh. If you're using the Tetrate Istio Distribution, then this TLS is FIPS verified. mTLS is configured through the PeerAuthentication resource, and should be set to STRICT to enforce mTLS between all components of the information system.
          Istio's AuthorizationPolicy controls service-to-service communication within the mesh. 
          Combined with Istio ingress and egress gateways, as well as a few installation settings, Istio can manage all traffic into and out of your deployment.
          In addition to AuthorizationPolicies controlling traffic in the mesh, Istio ingress gateways terminate HTTPS on behalf of applications in the mesh (AC-4 (4) - not required by moderate but valuable nonetheless). 
          By managing how traffic flows out of applications using VirtualServices or ServiceEntries, all traffic leaving your infrastructure can be channeled through an egress gateway. 
          Egress gateways can audit and limit how traffic flows to external services outside of the information system under control.

          # How does Istio help?
          When Istio is configured as above for AC-4 limiting access to services within the information system and controlling communication ingress and egress to and from the information system it provides logical separation of information flows. 
          Istio policies can provide this separation at the finest grain possible. For example, for HTTP traffic, Istio provides the ability to limit communication per verb and path, as well as based on header values or end-user credentials stored at headers, in addition to controlling traffic with the traditional network five-tuple. 
          Istio enforces the policy at the application instance itself.

          # How does Istio help?
          Istio produces logs for all traffic in the information system see AU-3 below for more information on what information is logged and how to configure additional information to be logged with each access. 
          As long as the privileged functions are exposed as network endpoints in the information system, Istio will log their use like it logs all other network traffic.
          Logging privileged use outside of the information system like using kubectl to access the cluster directly is outside of the scope of Istio's runtime logging.

          Istio can be configured to extract end-user credentials from requests for authentication (either locally, or forwarding them on to an external authorization service), and to disallow requests without authentication tokens. 
          This is configured using RequestAuthentication and AuthorizationPolicy resources, described at length in AC-4 above.
          Using this, Istio's authorization policy becomes documentation of services that do not require authentication.

          # How does Istio help?
          Istio generates access logs for all traffic in the mesh (ingress, internal, and egress) that is a superset of the data in the [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format). 
          For HTTP traffic, this includes timestamp, source and destination IPs, request verb, response code, and more. 
          You can get a full overview of the data that is provided [in the Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/logs/access-log/). 
          The format of these logs can be configured per deployment or globally at install time to conform with requirements of existing log analysis tools or other organizational needs.
          By default, Envoy sidecars in the mesh emit these logs as text to standard out. However, Envoy can be configured to forward this log data over gRPC to a server that aggregates (and potentially acts on) them. 
          This is called the [Access Log Service (ALS)](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/service/accesslog/v3/als.proto).
          These can be augmented by application-specific audit logging, but for many services (and HTTP services especially), the mesh's logs are sufficient to reconstruct an understanding of events to perform an audit.

          # How does Istio Help?
          If you’re using Istio to produce audit information (see AU-3, AU-3 (1)), then the logs that Istio produces are subject to AU-9 controls. 
          Protecting the logs that Istio produces is outside of the scope of Istio itself, but integrating your log ingestion and protection system with the logs that Istio produces, you can easily satisfy this requirement.
          Kubernetes RBAC should be configured to allow only specific users access to the log files Envoy produces, ideally no users should have direct access and instead only access logs via the log ingestion system (like Splunk).

          Istio generates logs for all network traffic - TCP connections, HTTP requests, etc. These events are a subset of all events defined by most organizations in AU-2 a. as worthy of audit. 
          See AU-3 for details of the information that can be generated, and AU-3 (1) for information on customizing it.
          If the only events to be logged per AU-2 a. are network events, then Istio satisfies AU-12 fully for the information system.

          Istio is configured with Kubernetes Custom Resources. As such it can be configured as code, and managed by your existing CM-5 conformant code management processes. 
          Kubernetes RBAC should be used to control who can change which configuration at runtime.
          BigBang implements CM-5 controls by implementing infrastructure as code practices, configuring Kubernetes RBAC to prevent humans from authoring configuration and allowing only continuous delivery systems (Flux, by default) to author runtime configuration. Since all configuration is managed in this CM-5 conformant way, Istio’s configuration is controlled in a CM-5 conformant way.

          Istio’s service inventory is updated continuously from the Kubernetes API server (the information system’s source of truth for what applications are running). Therefore, the inventory is updated when components of the information system are installed or removed. As a result, Istio implements CM-8 (1) for the information system.

          Istio can be used to implement authentication of end-user credentials for applications in the mesh. This is typically configured via Istio’s external authorization service or by validating JWTs on each request (see AC-3).
          If components in the information system are protected by Istio configured to validate end-user credentials, then Istio satisfies the authentication clause IA-2: “[the information system] authenticates organizational users (or processes acting on behalf or organizational users).” 
          Assigning user identities themselves, and ensuring their uniqueness, is out of scope of Istio. (Istio does assign identities to applications or processes running in the information system – see AC-4.)

          Istio assigned identities to runtime entities based on their Kubernetes service account. Service accounts are unique per (namespace, service account name) pair and are assigned to all pods in the cluster. 
          Pods should opt in to using a specific service account, but if they do not then Kubernetes provides a default service account per namespace.

          The identities Istio assigned are:
            a. Authorized for the specific application by checking against the Kubernetes API server (the system of record for runtime identities).
            b. Each service receives an identity from Kubernetes at runtime, whether it is assigned explicitly or not.
            c. Sent only to correct workloads because Istio authenticates runtime proofs (mainly, the pod’s service account token) in addition to authorizing the identity by checking with the Kubernetes API server.
            d. Service accounts in Kubernetes are unique. However, Kubernetes-level controls (out of the scope of Istio) need to be implemented to ensure that identities are not re-used.
            e. The Kubernetes service account lifecycle is out of scope of Istio. A Kubernetes-level control is need to satisfy this requirement.

          Istio provides encryption in transit for all applications in the mesh, and can also provide TLS termination at ingress and TLS origination at egress. Tetrate Istio Distribution (TID) is the only FIPS 140-2 Verified Istio distribution that exists. It is available from the Iron Bank.
          When using the TID FIPS builds, all communication between components of the information system is encrypted using FIPS 140-2 verified software.

          # How does Istio Help?
          Istio alone can not completely satisfy the SC-7 requirement, because Istio sits at Layer 4 and above, in other words it sits atop the IP network you provide it. However, Istio can aid in implementing boundary protection in your stack:
            a. Istio provides monitoring (AU-12) and control of traffic ingress into and egressing out of the cluster, as well as internally for all communication between components. If all information system components are running in the cluster, this satisfies SC-7 a.
            b. Istio operates at layer 4 and above - it cannot implement sub-networks at the IP layer. However, Istio can be used for logical separation of components at runtime (see AC-4 (21)). 
            Istio’s separation should be augmented with network-level separation, e.g. via a CNI plugin, to help implement a defense in depth strategy.
            c. The only ingress into the cluster is via Istio gateways (AC-3), egress is controlled by Istio gateways (AC-4). If all information system components are running in the cluster, this satisfies the needs of SC-7 c. 
            Further, access policy can be applied at both points, as well as at every application instance via Istio’s sidecar. This gives the organization the opportunity to implement more fine-grained controls than is needed by SC-7.

          # How does Istio Help?
          Like SC-7, Istio works in tandem with a few other components of the infrastructure to satisfy SC-7 (4). 
          For example, it’s common to use an identity-aware proxy (like Platform One’s CNAP), or even a cloud provider load balancer (like an ELB) as the initial interface for an external service, immediately passing the requests on to Istio’s ingress.
          For all of the information system components in the cluster:
            a. Istio provides an interface its ingress and egress gateways for external network traffic. Istio allows configuring how that interface is exposed, including ports and protocols as well as certificates that are served. See AC-4.
            b. Istio provides fine-grained layer 7 policy on each request to control how traffic flows through that ingress. It enforces this policy at ingress gateways to control the external traffic ingress into your information system. 
            Istio also enforces them at egress gateways to control how components of your information system communicate with external systems. See AC-4.
            c. Istio’s ingress gateways serve TLS (or mTLS) to external systems, and Istio provides mTLS between applications of the information system in the mesh. See AC-4.
            d. Istio must be explicitly configured to allow exceptions, either in AuthorizationPolicy documents controlling runtime access or in resource annotations exempting traffic from Istio’s sidecar. 
            These can be used as supporting documents for SC-7 (4) d., but will need to be augmented with organizational documentation citing specific mission needs and durations.
            e. This is an organizational activity out of the scope of Istio.

          At ingress and egress gateways, Istio denies all traffic that does not have explicit traffic routing policies in the form of a VirtualService attached to the gateways. 
          Inside of the mesh, and to control egress out to external services, you can author AuthorizationPolicies to limit access. 
          Those policies must be written in the “allow with positive matching” style. 
          Together, Istio implements the SC-7 (5) control on behalf of applications in the mesh.

          If the goal of the operator is not to distribute load across zones and regions but rather to restrict the regionality of failover to meet other operational requirements an operator can set a ‘failover’ policy instead of a ‘distribute’ policy.

          All outbound traffic from an Istio-enabled pod is redirected to its sidecar proxy by default, accessibility of URLs outside of the cluster depends on the configuration of the proxy. 
          By default, Istio configures the Envoy proxy to pass through requests for unknown services. Although this provides a convenient way to get started with Istio, configuring stricter control is usually preferable.
          Egress gateways can limit how traffic flows to external services outside of the information system under control.
          Istio can be configured to extract end-user credentials from requests for authentication (either locally, or forwarding them on to an external authorization service), and to disallow requests without authentication tokens.

          # How does Istio Help?
          Istio provides encryption in transit (TLS) for all applications in the mesh. This ensures both confidentiality and integrity of communication between applications deployed in the mesh. When you deploy a FIPS verified build of Istio (e.g. from the Tetrate Istio Distribution), that encryption conforms to FIPS 140-2 requirements. When Istio is configured in STRICT mTLS mode (see AC-4), it implements the SC-8 control for all applications in the mesh.

          See SC-8 for full details. In short, Istio provides encryption in transit (mutual TLS) for all applications in the mesh. When you’re using TID’s FIPS verified build of Istio, then this encryption also satisfies FIPS 140-2 requirements.

          # How does Istio Help?
          As outlined in the section on SC-8, Istio provides encryption in transit for all applications in the mesh. The Tetrate Istio Distribution’s FIPS Verified build is the only FIPS verified build of Istio and Envoy available, and satisfies requirements for FIPS 140-2 as well as the requirement to use the best available software for the job.

          Istio’s authorization features provide mesh-, namespace-, and workload-wide access control for your workloads in the mesh.
          Istio supports trust domain migration for authorization policy. This means if an Istio mesh needs to change its trust domain, the authorization policy doesn’t need to be changed manually.

          Istio generates logs for all network traffic - TCP connections, HTTP requests, etc. Can be configured for specific network traffic such as not authorized or approved by a system process or user.
          Network event alerts can be configured by organizations need.
